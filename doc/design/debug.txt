During development, OcherBook might be broken (incluing the boot menu), and you
need to fall back to the stock firmware to easily recover control.

To prevent OcherBoot startup, create a file ".ocherkill" in the root of any of
the "libraries" that OcherBook examines on startup.  In practice, this means
create such a file on the SD card and insert it before rebooting.
