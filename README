OcherBook is an open-source ebook reader, supporting multiple file formats and
output devices.  The major goals are:

    - Return control and privacy of the reading experience to the reader.
    - Modular design
    - Small with few external dependencies

To get the code:

    git clone git@github.com:ccoffing/OcherBook.git
    cd OcherBook
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

To get started, look in the doc directory, and/or "make help".

To see what platforms are supported and to what degree, look in doc/platforms/.
